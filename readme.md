# AuthOpenIDConnect - LimeSurvey Auth Plugin

## Added
Compared to the main project by [Jan Menzel](https://github.com/janmenzel/AuthOpenIDConnect), I tested the plugin with Limesurvey v5 (5.6.7) and it works just fine. I also added a feature, that a user needs to have a specific role to login. This feature can be de-/activated and the role and claim Name can be adjusted. I need this feature myself, because I use keycloak and dont want everybody in my realm to access limesurvey, only the ones who got the keycloak group to access limesurvey.

So my userinfo Token looks like this:

## Disclaimer
This plugin is **not maintained** by me anymore.\
Feel free to create a fork if you would like to customize it.

I am really grateful for your pull requests, but as I am not working with PHP and Limesurvey anymore I can't test them and ensure that everything works fine after a merge.

If you would like to continue to maintain this project please open an issue to get in touch with me. â˜º
